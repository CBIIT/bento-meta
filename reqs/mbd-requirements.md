# MDB Interface Requirements

MDB is the store for CTOS data models and terms. It needs an SME-friendly interface for performing daily terminology and model tasks.

Listing use cases and requirements here for the database and its interface.

## Use Cases

* I need to update the MDB with model changes made in YAML, so I can keep the MDB concordant with the offical YAML version.

* I need to add acceptable values to a property value domain, so I can register those additions officially

* I need to see all acceptable values for a property value domain, so I can determine whether to add a new value.

* I need to search terms across all models, so I can determine if a concept already exists in the MDB that can be reused for a new model.
