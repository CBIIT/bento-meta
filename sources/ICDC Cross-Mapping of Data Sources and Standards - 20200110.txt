OTHER NAME(S):

NOTE(S):
Whether administrative or preparatory activities are included in this time frame is up to whoever is defining the activity - this time frame is all that matters when the activity occurred.

The date range is an interval (IVL) data type, meaning it has a beginning (low) and end (high) values. It is also a datetime (TS.DATETIME) data type, meaning the beginning date and the end date can have uncertain values (e.g., a range). For example, if a subject was diagnosed with leukemia sometime in 2009 and that subject had a transplant (substance administration) sometime in 2010. We can surmise that the subject must have had a preparative regimen sometime between those times. Therefore the preparative regimen activity would have a beginning (low) date range of between 2009-01-01 and 2009-12-31; and an ending (high) date range of between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31. The precise data type mappings would be:
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.low.uncertainRange.low = 2009-01-01
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.low.uncertainRange.high = 2009-12-31

The date and time span when this activity began and ended.

EXAMPLE(S):
The date and time when a sample is taken from the subject. 

A dose of chemotherapy is given on June 12th starting at 9am and finishing at 12pm.

OTHER NAME(S):

NOTE(S):
Whether administrative or preparatory activities are included in this time frame is up to whoever is defining the activity - this time frame is all that matters when the activity occurred.

The date range is an interval (IVL) data type, meaning it has a beginning (low) and end (high) values. It is also a datetime (TS.DATETIME) data type, meaning the beginning date and the end date can have uncertain values (e.g., a range). For example, if a subject was diagnosed with leukemia sometime in 2009 and that subject had a transplant (substance administration) sometime in 2010. We can surmise that the subject must have had a preparative regimen sometime between those times. Therefore the preparative regimen activity would have a beginning (low) date range of between 2009-01-01 and 2009-12-31; and an ending (high) date range of between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31. The precise data type mappings would be:
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.low.uncertainRange.low = 2009-01-01
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.low.uncertainRange.high = 2009-12-31
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.high.uncertainRange.low = 2010-01-01
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.high.uncertainRange.high = 2010-12-31

NOTE(S):
There are multiple ways in which an identifier can be associated to a product; inherited from MaterialIdentifier.identifier, the association to ProcessedProduct.identifier, and the association to ProductRelationship.identifier.  If there is no context associated with the identifier, then MaterialIdentifier.identifier should be used.  However, if the identifier for a product would be different in different context, one of the other identifiers should be used.  If a kind of product is produced by different processors, and each processor assigns the product a different identifier, then ProcessedProduct.identifier should be used. If the product is used in multiple assemblies, and in each assembly it would be assigned a different identifier, then ProductRelationship.identifier should be used. "		"Note thatÉ
1) from a BRIDG perspective the identifier is on the material itself rather than the role of the material as a specimen because material collected from subjects can be a sample AND/OR a donation.  So the identifier belongs to the material itself, regardless of the role it plays.
2) BRIDG supports the notion that there can be more than one identifier on the same sample/specimen/material and there can be a typeCode defined in the ID data type to support that distinction. "

The study protocol may be of any type that involves subjects, including prevention, therapeutic, interventional or observational. 
- The StudyProtocol class represents the plan for the study which includes characteristics and planned activities which can be distilled into or abstracted from a version of the study protocol document and can exist even before the information is put into document form. 
- The StudyProtocolVersion class represents the details of the study protocol that may change over time. 
- The StudyProtocolDocument class represents the study protocol in a textual, possibly graphical, and human-readable form and is a grouping of the various study protocol document versions. 
- The StudyProtocolDocumentVersion class represents the document form of the study protocol version and is contains the details of the study protocol document as they exist[ed] at a particular point in time. 
- The StudyConduct class represents the execution of a study based on a study protocol definition which includes the scheduled and performed activities that are subject-specific as well as study-level and site-level activities.

The date and time span when this activity began and ended.

EXAMPLE(S):
The date and time when a sample is taken from the subject. 

A dose of chemotherapy is given on June 12th starting at 9am and finishing at 12pm.

OTHER NAME(S):

NOTE(S):
Whether administrative or preparatory activities are included in this time frame is up to whoever is defining the activity - this time frame is all that matters when the activity occurred.

The date range is an interval (IVL) data type, meaning it has a beginning (low) and end (high) values. It is also a datetime (TS.DATETIME) data type, meaning the beginning date and the end date can have uncertain values (e.g., a range). For example, if a subject was diagnosed with leukemia sometime in 2009 and that subject had a transplant (substance administration) sometime in 2010. We can surmise that the subject must have had a preparative regimen sometime between those times. Therefore the preparative regimen activity would have a beginning (low) date range of between 2009-01-01 and 2009-12-31; and an ending (high) date range of between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31. The precise data type mappings would be:
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.low.uncertainRange.low = 2009-01-01
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.low.uncertainRange.high = 2009-12-31
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.high.uncertainRange.low = 2010-01-01
IVL&lt;TS.DATETIME&gt;.high.uncertainRange.high = 2010-12-31
