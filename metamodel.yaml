      The predicate node allows some semantic info to be captured in the MDB.
      A predicate links concepts by means of has_subject and has_object
      links. Thus two concepts and a predicate can form a semantic triple.

          this is an interesting point in this representation- two terms could have the same value but be linked to (\"represent\")
          different concepts. Then the terms are \"homonyms\", but not \"synonyms\". The difference is in the graph context:
          a term\'s value is not its meaning, but the concept is, and the terms context is the value_set in which it is
          grouped (or the entity, including the entity\'s home model, which is linked to the concept)

UniversalNodeProperties:
  mustHave:
    - nanoid
  mayHave:
    - desc

PropDefinitions:
  handle:
    Req: true
    Type: string
    Desc: |
      the name of the entity in local vocabulary; not necessarily the term
      per se. For a Relationship, the handle is the "relationship
      type" in a Neo4j representation
  desc:
    Type: string
    Desc:
      A human-readable description of the entity.
  value:
    Req: true
    Type: string
    Desc:
      A code or other data representation of the Term.
  key:
    Req: True
    Type: string
    Desc:
      A string key.
  nanoid:
    Req: true
    Type: string
    Desc: 6char content-free uid for model entities
  model:
    Req: true
    Type: string
    Desc: model (handle) in which this entity participates 
  is_external:
    Type: boolean
    Desc: if this Origin represents an external (to BIDS/CTOS) standard (property missing => false)
  repository:
    Type: url
    Desc: |
      A url pointing to a (GitHub, e.g.) repository where the model is
      described or defined.
  url:
    Type: url
  pattern:
    Desc: A regular expression, set when value_domain = regexp
    Type: string
  origin_id:
    Type: string
    Req: true
    Desc: |
      the Origin authority\'s identifier for the Term - concept code,
      term ID, or similar
  origin_name:
    Type: string
    Desc: |
      the name for the Term's Origin, which should match the
      name property of an Origin node existing in the MDB.
  origin_definition:
    Type: string
    Desc: |
      The text definition of the Term as provided by the Origin authority
  multiplicity:
    Desc: |
      Descriptor of the number of these relationships that may exist between
      source and destination node instances.
    Type:
      - one_to_one
      - many_to_many
      - one_to_many
      - many_to_one
  is_required:
    Type: boolean
    Desc: |
      Indicates whether the property or relationship must be present in
      instances of the model.
  name:
    Type: string
    Desc: |
      Human readable identifier for the entity.
  units:
    Desc: |
      For a value_domain of 'number', this property gives the units of the
      number as a string; e.g., 'mg', 'cm','degrees'. Multiple allowable
      units are separated by semicolons: 'um;angstrom'. Unit string tokens
      could (should?) have their own Terms and Concepts for completeness.
      For other value_domain values, units should be unset
    Type: string
  value_domain:
    Req: true
    Type:
      - number
      - integer
      - string
      - datetime
      - boolean
      - regexp
      - url
      - value_set
